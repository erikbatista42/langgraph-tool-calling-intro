so ToolNode is basically like the tool manager your create on your own. When you do .bind_tools() the AI LLM (Anthropic in this  case) IS the tool manager that decides when to use the tools based on the tool function's docstrings and the function's purpose. 

Yes, that's a great way to understand it! Let me break down your analogy:
1. ToolNode = "Manual Tool Manager"
- You explicitly tell it which tools to run and when
You control the execution flow
Like in your example where you manually created the AIMessage with specific tool_calls
2. LLM with .bind_tools() = "Intelligent Tool Manager"
- The LLM understands the tools through their docstrings
- It autonomously decides when and how to use tools based on the conversation context
- It can choose which tools are appropriate for a given task
- It formats the tool calls correctly based on the tool specifications it learned
